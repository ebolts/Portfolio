          About Me
        </h2>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          I am fascinated by how software technologies are used in the industry
          to further our technological growth worldwide. I have an interest in
          software development and systems.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          I love learning about these topics and particularly how they will
          impact our current world going forward. For my future professional
          career, I plan to have a position as a software engineer at a
          reputable company where I can continue to learn new skills.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          My current goal is to get an internship position that would help gain
          me the knowledge and insights into real-world working environments. I
          have applied retail skills from working in the industry for 4 years
          throughout senior high school and after. From this I have gained a
          high standard of communication with strong interpersonal skills.
          Outside of my studies I continuously work on sharping my technical
          skills relating to software development through completing personal
          projects.
        </p>
        <p className="text-md pb-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          I have the ability to work individually or as a resourceful team
          member. I am keen to work with an organisation that shares my
          motivation to improve my skills and knowledge to make a positive
          impact on peopleâ€™s lives
